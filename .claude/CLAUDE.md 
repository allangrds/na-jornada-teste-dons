# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository

# Workflow

- Always create a todo list when working with medium or highter complex tasks
- Don't ask permission to read or find files, just do it
- Don't ask permission to execute tests, just do it
- Desconsiderar pasta my-app

# Code workflow

- Always follow TDD when creating code. First, create the test, then the implementation, check the test, and refactor if necessary

# Code

- Always create new files with kebab-case naming

# Typescript

- Never use any type
- Always try to use `type` instead of `interface`
- When creating a constant that will not actually be changed or that is not created from interpolation, create it with all caps and snake_case
- Always use arrow functions for function definitions
- Always export functions, props as named exports

# ReactJs

- Always use "import \* as React from 'react'"
- Always try to create pure components
  - create de componente folder
  - create a index.ts file that exports everything using export * from
  - create the component file using the same name as the folder
  - create the tests file using the same name as the folder with .test.tsx suffix
  - export the component as named export
